dmenu_smart is a replacement for dmenu_run that minimizes the amount of 
typing to run your most used programs. It does so by maintaining a 
cache file (~/.cache/dmenu_smart) where it stores how many times a 
program has been run. When starting dmenu_run, it shows a dmenu with 
all programs found by dmenu_path ordered by run count. Programs with 
identical run count are sorted alphabeitcally.

After installing new software, you have to run "dmenu_smart update" to 
update the cache file. The current run counts will be preserved.
